# FF_Neural_Network_Deep_Layers_Tuning
This repository conatins the code for a simple feed forward neural network trained on MNIST Hand written digits dataset. 
In this repo, I'm playing with changing the hidden layers number and size on the accuracy and loss of the model.
Each version contains different hidden layers and their size in the model and analyzing its effects on the accuracy and loss of the model.
